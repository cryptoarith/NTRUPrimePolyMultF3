# NTRUPrimePolyMultF3
This repository contains C implementation of the new hybrid polynomial multiplication methods over Z<sub>3</sub>[x] used in the paper "Faster Characteristic Three Polynomial Multiplication and Its Application to NTRU Prime Decapsulation" that are created by using the proposed algorithms N1, N2, and V1.
