# NTRUPrimePolyMultF3

This repository contains C implementation of the new hybrid polynomial multiplication algorithms over Z<sub>3</sub> that are used in the paper "Faster Characteristic Three Polynomial Multiplication and Its Application to NTRU Prime Decapsulation" by E. Yeniaras and M. Cenk. One can refer to the paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1336.pdf for the details of the algorithms given in this repocitory.

Benchmark tests for all implementations are performed on an Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-9750H processor running at 2600 MHz. The operating system is Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS and Linux Kernel 5.4.0. All software is compiled with gcc-9.3.0.

Note that we report the median of 100.000 executions for each of the polynomial multiplicaiton algorithms for the cycle counts.
