# NTRUPrimePolyMultF3
This repository contains the software regarding  new 4-way and 5-way polynomial multiplication methods described in this paper by E. Yeniaras and M. Cenk, "Faster characteristic three polynomial multiplication and its application to NTRU Prime decapsulation":
[10.1007/s13389-021-00282-7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13389-021-00282-7).

The methods are applied to one of the post-quantum cryptographic protocols NTRU Prime KEM, submitted to NIST PQC Standardization comptetition by Bernstein et al. Implemented in C, the new multiplication algorithms provide %37.3 reduction in the cycle count compared to Bernstein's method which he used in NTRU Prime submission.

Please refer to the paper: [10.1007/s13389-021-00282-7](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13389-021-00282-7) for the details.
